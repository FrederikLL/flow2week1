Day 1:

I've had alot of problems with a noClassFound error during this assignment. Several times ive had to 
go get some dependency found on a StackOverflow forum to fix the problem. Most people say it is a classpath
error but the classpath look correct in the pom file.

Day 2: I've gotten the endpoints to work, but am moving on to the next assignments due to the time ive spent on this.
also implemented test on most of the facade methods. MIssing some on the endpoints test

Day 3:
Same project as day 2. Exceptions works like they should for the methods.
Also a project called fredag but this is a mistake and its actually for thursday.


Day 4:
Didnt get to work much on this assignment but i created entity classes using the database tables provided. They were created with using netbeans wizard.
Also implemented Ã³ne of the methods using namedqueries.
